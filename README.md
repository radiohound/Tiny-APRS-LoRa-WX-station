Having a few Arduino Pro Mini and SX1278 RFM95W clones laying around, and being more confident now that I have written my "Lora APRS WX station", I wanted to make a test with the Arduino board.<br />
I also had some PCBs ordered past year that I didn't find the time to use.<br />

It took just a few hours behind the keyboard to make a new project come to life, a "Tiny LoRa APRS WX station".<br />
It worked so well that I worked a bit more on it and finally got a nice working project!<br />

I worked to make this project VERY LOW power. Indeed does it consume only 6-7 microamperes when in sleep!!<br />
